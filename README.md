# Skill Trees Project 

Skill Trees are printable templates that can you can use to visualize your skill progress, identify skill gaps and get inspired to try new things.  Color in the boxes as you go, starting at the base in the basics and moving to advanced skills at the top. 

Each skill tree has 73 skill or experience hexagonal tiles, ordered in a spectrum of basic skills at the bottom to more advanced skills at the top.  This includes 5 set your own goal tiles for you to tailor to your own interests.

# Skill Tree Generator
You can now make your own skill tree templates with the [Skill Tree Generator](https://schme16.github.io/MakerSkillTree-Generator/) designed by the talented [@schme16](https://github.com/schme16).  It's now a lot easier to make your own templates for personal use or adding to the repository.

How to use:
* Heading text is editable
* Click and drag to move the tiles
* Right click a tile to edit the text
* Save will download an SVG of the skill tree
* Left click to edit credit at the base to add your own name, or remove my name if you're just using for personal use (or don't want me to proof read/edit it).

# FAQ

**Were these made with AI?**           
No, these were made in collaboration with experts or using my own expertise, without any AI usage.  You can see the author credits at the base of each tree. Every expert has different experiences and I'm hoping to build a community on here and get many experts to proofread and peer review these trees to polish them into their best versions. 

**Will you keep the 'Skill Trees' name when they aren't really traditional skill trees?**               
While these templates are skill tree inspired, I realise they are not made up of connected nodes like traditional skill trees.  However, many games, like Borderlands, Starfield and others also have skill systems without connected nodes that still use the skill tree name. I have decided to keep the name 'Skill Trees' to make the concept easier to understand at a glance.
