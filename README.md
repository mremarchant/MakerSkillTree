# Skill Trees

Skill Trees are printable templates that can you can use to visualize your skill progress, identify skill gaps and get inspired to try new things.  Color in the boxes as you go, starting at the base in the basics and moving to advanced skills at the top. This includes 5 set your own goal tiles for you to tailor to your own interests.
